A discussion of the uses and limitations of server-side mouse tracking:

    * Uses:
          o Web based versions of traditional interaction systems:
                + Web based VNC (Remote Frame Buffer) client (e.g., ajaxvnc)
                + Web based Remote Desktop (Windows RDP) client (e.g., ajaxrd)
                + Web based toolkit (e.g., TkWeb)
                + Web based presentation layer (e.g., WebUI)
          o Advertisment
                + A method to detect if people are viewing your page actively (if they, their mouse will probably be moving)
                + Do people move their mouses in any particular pattern over your advertisement that might indicate that care about it at all ?
          o Usability Studies
                + Conduct research into how people are using your web page
          o Malicious
                + Can your mouse movement be used against you in some interesting ways ?
    * Limitations:
          o Speed
          o Time
